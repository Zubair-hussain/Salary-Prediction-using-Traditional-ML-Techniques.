# Salary Prediction using Traditional ML Techniques

This project demonstrates how to predict employee salaries using machine learning regression techniques. By analyzing years of experience, the model can accurately forecast potential salary, making it a powerful tool for HR, recruiters, and career planning platforms.

---

##  Project Overview

This is a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow built using:

- **Pandas & Numpy** for data handling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for modeling  
- **Streamlit** for deployment  

Users can enter their years of experience and instantly get a predicted salary value through an interactive web app.

##  Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/korpionn/salary-prediction-dataset)
- **Columns:**
  - `YearsExperience` â€“ Number of years the employee has worked
  - `Salary` â€“ Annual salary in USD

---

##  Features & Workflow

-  Cleaned and explored dataset  
-  Trained a **Linear Regression** model  
-  Evaluated with MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score  
-  Built a responsive **Streamlit web app**  
-  Deployed the model and web app using **Render**  
-  All code and assets organized for GitHub and Colab

##  Model Evaluation

| Metric      | Score     |
|-------------|-----------|
| MAE         | 6,286.45  |
| RMSE        | 7,059.04  |
| RÂ² Score    | 0.90      |

A strong RÂ² score of 0.90 means the model explains 90% of the variance in salary using only one feature â€” **Years of Experience**.
